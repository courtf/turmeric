Turmeric
=======

Named for my favorite make-this-tofu-kinda-look-like-eggs spice, "turmeric"
is a super micro boilerplate for quick sinatra-based web apps. It's
so micro that persistence frameworks aren't even present, since I often
need to select based on the needs of the project. Inspired by
kyledrake/sammy_davis_jr, tumeric is a super basic starting point, and
strives to be nothing more.

what you get
------------

* html5 layout that sources jQuery from google CDN
* Sinatra via Puma
* basic colorized logger (params, cookies, session)
* rspec and cucumber with basic websteps
